## 📦 **Required Plugins & Themes**

To ensure proper functionality, it's recommended to install the following components:

1. 🔌 [`Dataview`](obsidian://show-plugin?id=dataview) — Required. Powers the data logic behind the cards.
2. 🎛 [`Style Settings`](obsidian://show-plugin?id=obsidian-style-settings) _(optional)_ — For advanced visual customization, especially with the Minimal theme.
3. 🎨 [`Minimal Theme`](https://github.com/kepano/obsidian-minimal) _(optional)_ — A fully compatible theme for the best visual experience.

> ⚠️ The script **won't work without `Dataview`**. The other components are optional, but recommended for full styling support.

## 🚀 **Getting Started**

To start using the script:

1. Visit the repository:  
   👉 https://github.com/2PleXXX/obsidian-dataview-cards2

2. Click the **"Code"** button and choose **"Download ZIP"**  
   Or, if you're using Git:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/2PleXXX/obsidian-dataview-cards2.git
```

3. Extract the ZIP archive (if downloaded manually).

4. In Obsidian, open the extracted `Obsidian-Vault` folder as a new vault.

5. Explore the built-in home page (HUB) inside the vault. I recommend starting from the **"Starting Point"** note.
