## **Script Capabilities**

### ⚙️ What the Script Can Do:

The script transforms YAML entries (metadata) in Obsidian into beautiful, interactive cards with filters, sections, and visual components.

### ✨ What Can You Use This Script For?

🎓 Knowledge Base  
Group content by topic, track progress, add tags and ratings.

📺 Movie & TV Show Catalog  
Each card represents a movie or series: cover, title, genres, rating, video, and even soundtrack.

📚 Study Plans  
Visualize completed materials, progress in percentages, grades, and deadlines.

🧠 Idea and Note Collections  
Use filters and sections to track the status of each idea.

> No matter what you want to track — books, movies, tasks, or people — everything will be clean, structured, and interactive.

## 📦 **Required Plugins & Themes**

To ensure proper functionality, it's recommended to install the following components:

1. 🔌 [`Dataview`](https://github.com/blacksmithgu/obsidian-dataview) — Required. Powers the data logic behind the cards.
2. 🎛 [`Style Settings`](https://github.com/mgmeyers/obsidian-style-settings) _(optional)_ — For advanced visual customization, especially with the Minimal theme.
3. 🎨 [`Minimal Theme`](https://github.com/kepano/obsidian-minimal) _(optional)_ — A fully compatible theme for the best visual experience.

> ⚠️ The script **won't work without `Dataview`**. The other components are optional, but recommended for full styling support.
