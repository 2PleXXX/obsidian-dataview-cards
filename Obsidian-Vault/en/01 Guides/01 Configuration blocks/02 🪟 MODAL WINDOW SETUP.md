# **BLOCK 02 🪟 MODAL WINDOW SETUP**

> 💡 Example block configuration:

```js
modalBehavior: "hold",
```

---

## 🕹 `modalBehavior`

Defines how the modal window behaves when interacting with an image:

- `"hold"` – the window opens **while holding down** the left mouse button (LMB). Release it — and the window closes.
    
- `"click"` – a single click **opens** the window; a second click **closes** it.
    

> ✅ Convenient: `hold` mode is great for quick previews; `click` is better for detailed viewing.
