## 🧰 How to Update the Script

1. Click the **"Current Version"** button — it will open the full GitHub repository.  
   Or click **"Update Script"** — it will take you directly to the `universal-cards-core.js` file.

2. On the opened page, find the **“Download raw file”** button (usually located in the top right corner).

3. Click it — the file will start downloading.

4. Locate the old version of the `universal-cards-core.js` file on your computer  
   (for example: `"D:\MyObsidianVault\scripts\universal-cards-core.js"`).

5. Replace the old file with the downloaded one. It’s recommended to restart Obsidian afterward.
