## 🧰 How to Update the Script

1. Click on the script version — this will open the full repository on GitHub.  
   Or click **"Update Script"** — this will take you directly to the `scripts-core` folder on GitHub, where you’ll see the files that need updating or adding.

2. On the opened page, click on one of the files and find the **Download raw file** button (usually located in the top-right corner).

3. Click it — the file will start downloading.

4. Locate the old version of the file on your computer, for example `universal-cards-core.js` (e.g., in `"D:\MyObsidianVault\scripts\universal-cards-core.js"`).

5. Replace the old file with the newly downloaded one. It is recommended to restart Obsidian afterwards.

6. Repeat this process for each file that needs to be updated.

> [!important] IMPORTANT  
> **Before updating, it’s recommended to make a backup of your Obsidian vault.**
