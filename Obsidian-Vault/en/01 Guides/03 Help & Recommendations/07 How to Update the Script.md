# 🔄 07 How to Update the Script

From time to time, you may receive a notification that a new version of the script is available.  
Updating gives you access to new features and bug fixes.

## 🧰 How to Update the Script

1. Click the **"Current Version"** button — it will open the full GitHub repository.  
   Or click **"Update Script"** — it will take you directly to the `universal-cards-core.js` file.

2. On the opened page, find the **“Download raw file”** button (usually located in the top right corner).

3. Click it — the file will start downloading.

4. Locate the old version of the `universal-cards-core.js` file on your computer  
   (for example: `"D:\MyObsidianVault\scripts\universal-cards-core.js"`).

5. Replace the old file with the downloaded one. It’s recommended to restart Obsidian afterward.

## ⚠️ IMPORTANT!

Sometimes you may need to update not only the main script file `universal-cards-core.js`, but also additional files, such as:

- the style file `[CARDS]universal-dataview-cards.css`;
    
- the localization file `universal-cards-lang.js`.

**Before updating, it is strongly recommended to:**

1. Make a backup of your Obsidian vault;
    
2. Save any manual changes you’ve made to the style or localization files — they may be overwritten during the update.
