# **05 Automatically Enabling Preview Mode**

You may have noticed that in the card examples I use a property called `obsidianUIMode`:  
![[View mode.png]]

This works thanks to the plugin [Force note view mode](obsidian://show-plugin?id=obsidian-view-mode-by-frontmatter).

What do you need to do?

1. Download and enable the plugin.  
2. Add a new property called `obsidianUIMode`.  
3. Set its value to `"preview"`.  
4. Done!
