# **🧭 ROADMAP**

## *All the essential information for using the script — in one place*

---

> **Don’t be intimidated by the size of the script.**  
> At first glance it may seem large, but in practice — it’s simple and intuitive.  
> Try it a couple of times and you’ll get the hang of it easily! 😉

Before writing your config, it is **highly recommended** to read:

## 🧱 Configuration Blocks

This guide uses the example script [[03 All in one]], which showcases the full functionality.

We strongly recommend reviewing how the template is built, and carefully reading through each block.  
Just use the template as a starting point and adjust it for your needs.

Pay close attention to commas, brackets, and other symbols — they are crucial!

Sometimes cards may not display correctly. Examples include:

- You updated values in YAML, but the cards **didn’t refresh**.
- You changed the config, but **saw no results**, even after reloading the note.

In such cases:

1. 🔄 **Fully restart Obsidian.**  
   This often clears internal caches and restores proper script behavior.
    
2. ✅ If restarting doesn't help, **double-check your config and YAML** — there may be a typo, missing parameter, or incorrect field name.
    
3. 🆘 If the issue persists even after all checks, **contact the [[08 Contact the Author|author]]**.

## ⚙️ A Few Words About Script Editing

You can customize the script’s core or localization to suit your needs.  
However, since **updates are supported**, this may affect the preservation of your changes.

There are several options:

1. Simply **don’t update** the script.  
2. Disable version update notifications if you don’t plan to update.
3. **Compare versions manually**, and apply any changes to your customized version by hand.
