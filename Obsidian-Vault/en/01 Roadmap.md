# **🧭 ROADMAP**

## *All the necessary information for using the script — in one place*

---

> **Don't be intimidated by the size of the script.**  
> At first glance, it may seem large, but in practice — everything is simple and intuitive.  
> Try it a couple of times — and you'll quickly get the hang of it! 😉

> ☑️ For convenience, checkboxes are provided below — you can mark the sections you've completed.

Before starting to write your config, I **recommend** reading [[04 How to Edit Code More Easily]] and [[02 Recommendations for Naming YAML Fields]].

## 🧱 Configuration Blocks

This uses the [[03 All in one]] version of the script, as it demonstrates all the features.

I highly recommend looking at how the template is structured and going through all the blocks carefully, reading each one in detail.  
Just take the template as your base and customize it for your needs.

Pay close attention to commas, brackets, and other symbols — this is very important!

## ⚙️ A Few Words About Modifying the Script

You can make changes to the core of the script to suit your needs.  
However, since the script supports **receiving updates**, this may affect the preservation of your custom changes.

There are several approaches:

1. Simply **do not update** the script.  
2. Completely **unlink the script from GitHub** → [[02 How to Unlink from GitHub]]  
3. **Compare changes** between versions and manually apply them to your modified script.
